# Sprint-02

## Self-Critique

### My Role: Ryan Jackson,Developer

**In Sprint‑02, I took on the role of Developer, and I was primarily responsible for implementing the backend and helping integrate the PostgreSQL/MySQL schema into the running environment. I also assisted the team with debugging.**

### Assigned Tasks and Artifacts

**1. `mysql_efficient_schema.sql`**

Commit: d7281e74 Syntax error sweep and matching SQL Schema to erd 
PM Card:Dev - MySQL match to ERD (3pts)

**2. Python Flask Backend**

Commit: 1b1d4c0 Python Flask backend additions
PM Card: Dev - Python Flask backend additons/organization (5pts)

**3. Backend Folder**

Commit: 9779e19 Moved all Backend related Python files to the backend folder
PM Card: Dev - Python Files moved to backend folder (3pts)

**4. MySQL change**

Commit: 89f7db9 Update App.py database host
PM Card: Dev - Changed MySQL default from 127.0.0.1 to Backend-yourinitials-vm0.service.consul(2pts)


### Self-Critique and Areas of Improvement

**What went wall:** 

- I was able to deliver functional additions to the application with most of the SQL matching our Figma designs, and I fixed several deployment mismatches
- I was very open with what I don't know so when I did need to communicate during debugging I was very communicative and open

**Where I can improve:**

- I did end up missing team meetings due to personal reasons so communicating with teammates and/or being more available

Areas of Strength:
Even with the limitations of his schedule/communication he still made an active effort to be apart of the project albiet at the end.

Proactive about checking on blockers


Areas for Improvement:

Communication style: Sometimes he can come off a bit passive aggressive. Even though I understand due to his stress but it knowing the cause doesn't negate the effect completely
